'''Our regex contains three groups:
1 - first part of the email address.
2 - domain name without the suffix.
3 - the domain suffix.'''


[\w\.-]+ matches one or more word character, dot or dash.
The regex above says that the string should contain a word (with dots and dashes allowed), followed by the @ sign, then another similar word, then a dot and another word.
